# MinimaxTicTacToe

## Overview
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game, where a player plays against an AI (bot). The bot uses the minimax algorithm, thus it searches all possible game states and chooses the best one, making it unbeatable.

## What I learned
- **MiniMax** Algorithm
- Basic **Python**

## How To Play
1. The player is prompted to choose between 'X' or 'O'.
2. The player selects a number between 1 and 9, corresponding to the positions on the board (1 being the top-left corner and 9 being the bottom-right)
3. The bot takes its turn
4. Repeat until there is a winner or a tie.
